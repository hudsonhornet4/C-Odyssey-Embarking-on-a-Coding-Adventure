#  C-Odyssey-Embarking-on-a-Coding-Adventure
## Introduction
Hi, 👋 welcome to C++ Odyssey. I created this repository for the purpose of learning C++ features, its reference, etc. I tried to add everything possible, or at least what I remember. I'll try to explain everything the way I understood it myself. Answers, explanations will be from different sites, such as **[StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Сplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/), [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)**, etc. Of course, I will leave links to the answers and their authors, so that you can visit the links and perhaps understand better. Alright, hope you will like it. But better just check it, instead of reading this. Good luck in your journey.

I apologize in advance for possible mistakes in English.🇺🇸🇬🇧

## What's included?
- 📚 **Theory about C++**. It may seem like a boring part, but no matter how, I recommend visiting anyway, because it is no less important than the code.
- 🗒 **C++ Reference**. Trust me, this is a very interesting part that you won't have a problem with.. you shouldn't have..
- 🗣 **Soft Skills**. I underestimated the part before I began to understand, but the importance of this part is no less than technical skills. But you will see more later.
- 📊 **Data Structures and Algorithms** . You shouldn't skip this part, the importance of DSA is very high. And with the help of it, you will increase the chances of getting a high-paying job.
- ⚙ **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems with explanations** . This platform can perfectly prepare you for your future interview, with it you will better understand DSA and improve your skills in _Problem Solving_. Apart from that, it can also boost your confidence in job interviews. Maybe even girls, who knows. 🤷‍♂️
- ❓ **Quizes and questions**. At the end of each topic. To check yourself that you didn’t just take a look at the topic, but were really interested.
