### What's an IDE?
The IDE is where you will spend most of your time. In short, **it's a development environment**, a place where you'll write your code, debug, complain about bugs, and find new quirks every day.
Some of them can help you give a hint about your error, keep your files organized, some of them can even help you with **CMake**, and some of them can help you leave this programming language. Yes, i'm talking about you, Vim.

## Visual Studio Code 2022
Visual Studio is an IDE made by Microsoft. Very pleasant place for C++ Developers. It has a lot of feautures, which makes this IDE is so powerful:
 - **IntelliSense**: The All-Knowing Advisor
   IntelliSense is like having a wise old mentor by your side, guiding you through the arcane world of C++ coding. With its magical autocompletion and real-time error detection, it anticipates your coding needs and provides helpful suggestions, saving you from spellbinding typos and syntax errors.
 - **Powerful Debugger**:
  What's a _debugger_? That's a program which can help you find your errors , You can use a debugger to halt the execution of your program when it reaches a particular place in your code.
You don't need to download anything, it's inside the software ( Visual Studio )
