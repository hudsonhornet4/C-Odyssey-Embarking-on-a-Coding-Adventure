### What's an IDE?
The IDE is where you will spend most of your time. In short, **it's a development environment**, a place where you'll write your code, debug, complain about bugs, and find new quirks every day.
Some of them can help you give a hint about your error, keep your files organized, some of them can even help you with **CMake**, and some of them can help you leave this programming language. Yes, i'm talking about you, Vim.

## Visual Studio Code 2022
Visual Studio is an IDE made by Microsoft. Very pleasant place for C++ Developers. It has a lot of feautures, which makes this IDE is so powerful:
 - **IntelliSense**: The All-Knowing Advisor
   IntelliSense is like having a wise old mentor by your side, guiding you through the arcane world of C++ coding. With its magical autocompletion and real-time error detection, it anticipates your coding needs and provides helpful suggestions, saving you from spellbinding typos and syntax errors.
 - **Powerful Debugger**:
  What's a _debugger_? That's a program which can help you find your errors , You can use a debugger to halt the execution of your program when it reaches a particular place in your code.
You don't need to download anything, it's inside the software ( Visual Studio )
- **Extensions Ecosystem**:
Visual Studio Code has a thriving extensions ecosystem that allows you to customize and enhance your coding experience. From theme customization to language support, there's an extension for almost everything. You can explore the marketplace and find extensions that suit your specific needs and coding preferences. It's like having a magical bag of tools to make your coding journey even more enjoyable.

- **Version Control Integration**:
Whether you're working on a solo project or collaborating with a team, version control is essential to keep track of changes and maintain code integrity. Visual Studio Code seamlessly integrates with popular version control systems like Git, making it effortless to manage your codebase, track changes, and collaborate with other developers.

- **Task Automation**:
Visual Studio Code supports task automation, enabling you to define and run various tasks to streamline your development workflow. Whether it's building your project, running tests, or deploying your application, you can automate repetitive tasks and save valuable time.

- **Integrated Termina**l:
No more juggling between multiple windows or terminals. Visual Studio Code comes with an integrated terminal that allows you to execute shell commands directly from the IDE. This feature makes it easy to interact with your project, run scripts, and manage your development environment, all within one place.

- **Live Share**:
Collaborative coding becomes a breeze with Visual Studio Code's Live Share feature. You can invite other developers to join your coding session in real-time, allowing them to view and edit your code as if they were sitting right next to you. It fosters teamwork, enables instant feedback, and accelerates the development process.
