### What's an IDE?
The IDE is where you will spend most of your time. In short, **it's a development environment**, a place where you'll write your code, debug, complain about bugs, and find new quirks every day.
Some of them can help you give a hint about your error, keep your files organized, some of them can even help you with **CMake**, and some of them can help you leave this programming language. Yes, i'm talking about you, Vim.
