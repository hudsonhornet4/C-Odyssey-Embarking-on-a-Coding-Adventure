# History
Once upon a time in the late 1970s, a brilliant computer scientist named Bjarne Stroustrup set out on a quest to improve the programming language C. You see, C was already a powerful and widely-used language, but Bjarne had a vision to make it even better.
In 1983, after years of hard work and dedication, Bjarne unveiled his creation to the world - **C++**. The name itself hinted at the improvements he made, indicating that C++ was an evolution of the original C language.
What made C++ so special was its ability to support object-oriented programming, a paradigm that allowed programmers to organize their code in a more modular and flexible way. This was a groundbreaking concept that opened up new possibilities for software development.

As the years passed, C++ gained popularity and became the language of choice for many programmers working on a wide range of applications, from operating systems to video games. Its versatility and performance made it a valuable tool in the world of computer science.

But the story doesn't end there. Bjarne's creation continued to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of the software industry. New features were added, bugs were fixed, and the language grew stronger with each iteration.

Today, C++ remains a cornerstone of modern programming, loved by some for its power and efficiency, and perhaps feared by others for its complexity. But one thing is for sure - C++ has left an indelible mark on the world of software development, and its legacy continues to shape the way we write code.


# Modern

## Where C++ is used?

- **Operating Systems**: C++ plays a crucial role in the development of operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and many others. Its performance and low-level capabilities make it an ideal choice for handling system-level tasks.

- **Game Development**: C++ is a favorite among game developers due to its high performance and ability to directly access hardware resources. Many popular video games, both on desktop and console platforms, are built using C++. Games such as Fortnite, Mortal Kombat 11, Half-Life 2 were created just in this language.

- **Graphics and Animation**: Applications for computer graphics, animation, and visual effects often rely on C++. C++ provides the necessary power and efficiency to create visually stunning and interactive experiences.

- **Embedded Systems**: C++ is commonly used in embedded systems programming, where efficiency and direct hardware access are essential. Devices like microcontrollers, automotive systems, and IoT devices often run on C++.

- **Financial Software**: In the finance industry, where speed and precision are critical, C++ is frequently used to build trading platforms, risk management systems, and other financial applications.

- **Database Systems**: C++ is employed in developing high-performance database systems that handle large volumes of data and complex queries efficiently.

- **Graphics and Game Engines**: C++ is the language of choice for developing graphics and game engines that power various applications, simulations, and virtual reality experiences.

- **Web Browsers**: Some components of web browsers, including rendering engines and performance-critical sections, are often implemented in C++ for faster and smoother browsing experiences.

- **Compilers and Interpreters**: C++ is utilized in the development of compilers and interpreters for various programming languages, including C++ itself.

- **Medical Devices and Scientific Instruments**: C++ is used in building software for medical devices and scientific instruments that require real-time processing and precise control.

- **Networking**: C++ is employed in networking applications, such as routers, switches, and network protocols, to ensure efficient data transmission.
