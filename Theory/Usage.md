# Companies which use C++

- ## Google
  Google uses C++ extensively for various purposes, including building critical components of their search engine, networking infrastructure, and backend services. C++ is preferred for its performance and efficiency in handling large-scale systems.
  - _For example_ : Using C++ Search Engines like Google for:
     - **Crawling**, which is used to explore the internet by visiting websites.
     - **Indexing**, which is used to collect keywords, it removes words like "is", "the" and etc.
         Let's say we've crawled and indexed three web pages:
       - 🌐**1st Page**: "The C++ Programming Language basics". 🔑 **Keywords** : C++, Programming, Language, basics.
       - 🌐**2nd Page**: "Python language basics". 🔑 **Keywords**: Python, basics.
       - 🌐**3rd Page**: "C++ and Python differences". 🔑 **Keywords**: C++, Python, differences.
         - - - -
         In the inverted index, the entries would look like this:
       - **C++** : 1st and 3rd pages.
       - **Programming**: 1st page.
       - **Language**: 1st and 2nd pages.
       - **basics**: 1st and 2nd pages.
       - **Python**: 2nd and 3rd pages.
       - **differences**: 3rd page.
          - - - -
    - **Ranking**, which is used to check trustworthiness of websites, their relevance, keyword frequency, freshness, CTR (Click-Through Rate), and personalization.
    - **Retrieval**, which is the process of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources
  

- ## 🖌️ Adobe
  Adobe uses C++ to develop popular software like **Adobe Photoshop** and **Adobe Illustrator**. C++ is chosen for its ability to handle complex graphics and image processing tasks efficiently.
  - _For example_ : In Photoshop you can manipulate and enhance photographs, create digital artwork, and perform advanced image processing tasks. In Illustrator : Create scalable illustrations, logos, icons, and other graphics.
- ## Facebook
  Facebook utilizes C++ for parts of its backend infrastructure, as well as performance-critical features in mobile applications. The open-source C++ library, [**Folly**](https://github.com/facebook/folly "Git Repository"), is also developed by Facebook. Mark Zukerberg himself knows C++ as well.
- ## 🚀 NASA
    C++ is employed by NASA for various space-related projects and simulations due to its ability to handle complex calculations and real-time processing.
    -- For example **Robotics** to control and manage the movement and operations of robotic devices and rovers or **Spacecraft Control Systems** for spacecraft control systems, such as attitude control, navigation, and guidance systems.
- ## Boeing
    C++ is also used in Boeing, which is obvious, for example in Flight Simulators, to train pilots. Or Aerospace Engineering, where C++ is used for modeling and simulation of aircraft components and systems.
- ## 🍏 Apple
    Even in Apple, C++ is also used. Operating Systems like macOS and iOS and other components were written in C++. Also C++ is used in their ⚙️ **Hardware System.**
