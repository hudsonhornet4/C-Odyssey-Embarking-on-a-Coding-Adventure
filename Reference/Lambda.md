# Lambda Expressions 
In C++, a lambda expression is a nifty way to create an **anonymous function object**, which is also known as a closure. 
It's like a mini-function that you can define right where you need it, without having to give it a name.
<br>Imagine you have a small piece of code that you want to use as a function, but it's not something you want to write a full-fledged function for.</br>
Lambda to the rescue! It lets you encapsulate those few lines of code and use it as a function-like object.
Lambdas are especially handy when you want to pass a simple function as an argument to other functions or algorithms. Instead of defining a separate function, you can create a lambda right on the spot and pass it directly to where it's needed.
Here's a simple scheme to understand how a lambda looks:
```
[what we capture](parameters) -> return-type {
   // code
};
```
Here are some important points to note about lambda expressions in C++:

- **Capture Clause (Optional)**: The capture clause allows you to capture variables from the surrounding scope, making them accessible within the lambda function. It's written inside square brackets **([])**.
 For example, **[x, &y]** captures **x** by value and **y** by reference.
- **Parameters (Optional)**: The parameters are like the input of the lambda function, and they are optional. You can specify the parameters inside parentheses.
For example, ```(int a, double b)``` declares two parameters **a** and **b** of the specified types.
- **Return Type (Optional)**: In most cases, the return type of the lambda can be deduced automatically by the compiler. This is called **"auto return type deduction."**
But in complex cases where the return type cannot be inferred, you may need to explicitly specify it using the **->** arrow syntax.
- **Function Body**: The body of the lambda function is enclosed in curly braces **({})**, just like a regular function. You can write any valid C++ code inside the body, and it will be executed when the lambda is called.
For example:
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 5;

    auto ourLambda = [x]() mutable {
        x += 10;
    };

    ourLambda();

    return 0;
}

```
- **Changing Behavior of the Lambda**: When you use the mutable keyword in a lambda expression, it indicates that the lambda's ```operator()``` (the function call operator) is allowed to modify the captured variables. 
By default, a lambda's ```operator()``` is considered **const**, which means it can't modify captured variables.
- **Enabling Modification of Captured Variables**: The primary purpose of mutable is to give you the flexibility to modify the values of the captured variables within the lambda's body, even if they were initially captured by value.
- **How to Use mutable**: The mutable keyword is placed before the parameter list (if any) and the return type (if specified) of the lambda expression. You can use it with both explicit and implicit lambda captures.
```c++
void simpleBlock(){ //scope start
  double a = 55.4;
  double c = -11.1;
  [&](){ // as i said before, & means that we captured all variables in scope 'by reference'.
      a = 100.0; //we changed value of original "a"
      c = 8.8; // we also changed the value of original "c"
};

} // scope end, until this bracket we capture all variables within this block

```
#### What does 'by reference' mean?
I will explain more in Pointers.md. But let's tell about it anyway. So when we create a function, it starts to have own adress in our memory, every variable has own adress. 
And by adding ```&``` before variable in our square brackets, we point at the adress of variable, which means we can change it , modify. If we don't add ```&```, then our funcitons/lambdas will create a copy of variable, without modifying.
```c++
int main(){
  int a = 5;
  int b = 10;
  [&a, b](){ // we took 'a' by reference, meaning we point at our 'a' in block and using this right now. 
    //But 'b' captured by value, which means we do not change OUR b, we just created a copy.
      a = 25;
      b = 8;
  };
//Let's print changed values now
std::cout << "a = " << a << "\n";
std::cout << "b = " << b << "\n";
}
```
 Alright, let's print it out right now.

```
a = 25
b = 10
```

Oh my, what's that? Why ```b``` is still 10? But we changed it.
<br>No, Jimmy, **we didn't**. When we capture variable by reference, we  using its adress, coming to its house and changing it. But with ```b``` situation
is a little bit different, we created a copy of ```b```'s house, and came in copy-house, changed it to 8, but real ```b``` which we needed is still the same 10. ü•∑</br>

ü§î Capturing by value:
- Creates a copy of the variable.
- Modifications inside the lambda do not affect the original variable.
- The copy may be stored in a different memory location, aka new adress/house
- Changes made to the copy do not propagate to the original variable.

üè† Capturing by reference:
- Captures a reference to the original variable.
- Modifications inside the lambda affect the original variable.
- Operates directly on the original variable's memory location.
- Changes made to the reference propagate to the original variable.

But if you're impressed by ability of ```&``` in lambda, you can take all variable's values in a scope/block, not by reference. You just need to write ```[=]```
instead of ```[&]```
```c++
void simpleBlock(){
      bool a = true;
      bool b = false;
      [=](){ // we took all variables in scope by 'value'
        a = false;
        b = true;
        //let's print these copies out
        std::cout << "Inside lambda:\n copy a = " << a << "\n copy b = " << b << "\n";
      };
  std::cout << "Outside lambda:\n original a = "<< a << "\n original b = " << b;
}



int main(){
//let's call this function in 'main'
      simpleBlock(); //it's empty because we didn't include any, all variables created in function/block itself
}
```
As the result : 
```
Inside lambda:
copy a = 0
copy b = 1
Outside lambda:
original a = 1
original b = 0
```
#### Giving a name
We also can give a name to our lambda functions. For example : 
```c++
int main(){ //scope start

auto lambda = [](auto a, auto b){ // we didn't capture any, just created a function in our 'main'
      //but now 'lambda' function supposed to have 2 parameters
      return a - b; //created function to calculate a and b

}; // scope end
```
Alright we created a function, what's then? Let's use it. First, we can be surprised to see new words such as ```auto```, in this case, ```auto``` mean, that we can use numbers,
either ```double``` or ```int``` , because if we used ```bool```.. how would you calculate truth and lie?  Let's add ```double``` here:
```c++
int main(){ //scope start

auto lambda = [](auto a, auto b){ 
      return a - b;
};
double firstNum = 25.0;
double secondNum = 14.3;
//now we can give a result of our function to another 'double' variable
double result = lambda(firstNum, secondNum); // we inserted our 2 variables in function, to calculate.
//now, our `result` variable has value 10.7
} // scope end
```
Since we inserted ```double```  in our function, now all ```auto``` kinda replaced by ```double```.
