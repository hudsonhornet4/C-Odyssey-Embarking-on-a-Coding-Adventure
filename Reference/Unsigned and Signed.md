# Understanding Signed and Unsigned Data Types in C++
## Introduction ðŸ“š
  Data types play an important role in how we store and manipulate information in C++. When working with integers, situations are often encountered where the sign of the number is important.
Both ```signed``` and ```unsigned``` data sets give us the flexibility to efficiently handle both positive and negative values.
In this guide, weâ€™ll explore the concept of signed and unsigned data types, their differences, and when to use them effectively. 
Eventually you will have a clearer understanding of how these types of data can affect your code and help you make informed decisions along your programming journey.
Letâ€™s start this exploration together and unlock the potential of signed and unsigned data types in C++. Ready, my stablemate? Letâ€™s start.

### unsigned
In C++, "unsigned" and "signed" are data type modifiers that can be applied to integral data types such as int, short, long, char, etc.
Unsigned and Signed template of declaration: 
```C++
[unsigned or signed] [data type] [name] = [value]
```

- **unsigned**: is used to declare variables that can **only have non-negative values**. They cannot store negative values or represent signed numbers. This modifier effectively extends the range of positive values that a variable can hold.
Example :
```c++
   unsigned int a = 25;
   unsigned short b = 15;
   unsigned int weirdo = -1; 
   ```
If you know that your number is always going to be positive, aka non-negative, then you can/should use ```unsigned```. But if we try to write negative number with ```unsigned```, here's it's variable ```weirdo``` 
and it has -1, which is negative, we will get 4,294,967,295. Why? Since our number is non-positive, then it will go vice-versa and will go from 4,294,967,295 to 0, for example, if we will give ```weirdo``` value -**2**
then we will get 4,294,967,294, and etc. 
### signed
What do we have here? As i understood, ```signed``` is often used only with ```char```.
It only makes a difference with char, because

- It is not defined whether char is signed or unsigned.
- ```char```, ```signed char```, and ```unsigned char``` are three distinct types anyway.

So you should use signed if you need a ```signed char``` (which is probably rarely). Other than that, I can't think of a reason. [[Link]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28012943/what-is-the-actual-use-of-signed-keyword "About Signed")
Sometimes we can use our ```char``` to represent numbers, but.. why would we, if have ```int```, ```double``` and other char's bullies? The reason is it's because ```char```'s size is **1 byte**, but ```int```'s size is **4 bytes.**
```c++
unsigned char = 10; //range of unsigned char is 0 to 255.
signed char = -15; //range of signed char is -128 to 127
```
### How to check size of our variables?
 To check sizes of our declared variables, you can use ```sizeof```, which usually returns the size in byes of data type or variable.
 Let's check:
 We can try to check sizes of our data types, let's take ```bool``` and ```double```. Here's how to check it.
 ```c++
std::cout << "The size of bool is " << sizeof(bool) << "\n"; // The size of bool is 1
std::cout << "The size of double is " << sizeof(double) << "\n"; //The size of double is 8 byes, what a big guy!
// about std::cout and "\n"  you'll be able to find in other .md files :)
```
