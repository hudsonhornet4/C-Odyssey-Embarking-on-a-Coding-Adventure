# Integral Data Types:

## int: 
Represents integer values, such as -3, 0, or 42.
## char: 
Used to store single characters like 'a', 'B', or '$'.
## bool: 
Holds either true or false, representing logical values.
- - - - 
#  Floating-Point Data Types:
## float: 
Stores single-precision floating-point numbers, typically used for non-critical computations.
## double: 
Represents double-precision floating-point numbers, providing higher precision than float.
- - - - 
# Void Data Type:

## void: 
Used to indicate that a function returns no value or that a pointer does not point to any type.
- - - - 
# Modifier Data Types:
## signed: 
This keyword can be used with integral data types to indicate that the variable can hold both positive and negative values.
## unsigned:
Used with integral data types to represent only non-negative values.
- - - - 
# Size-Specific Data Types:

## short: 
Represents small integers with a smaller range than int.
## long: 
Stores larger integers with a greater range than int.
## long long: 
Offers even larger range than long for long integers.

# Fixed-Size Data Types:

## int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t: 
Signed integers with fixed sizes of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits respectively.
## uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t: 
Unsigned integers with fixed sizes of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits respectively.
# Character Data Types:

## wchar_t: 
Represents wide characters, often used for internationalization.
## char16_t: 
Stores 16-bit Unicode characters.
## char32_t: 
Stores 32-bit Unicode characters.
